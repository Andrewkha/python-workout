"""
Our zookeepers have a macabre sense of humor when it comes to placing animals together, 
in that they put wolves and sheep in the first cage, and snakes
and birds in the other cage. (The good news is that with such a configuration,
the zoo will be able to save on food for half of the animals.) Define a dict
describing which animals can be with others. The keys in the dict will be classes,
and the values will be lists of classes that can compatibly be housed with the
keys. Then, when adding new animals to the current cage, youâ€™ll check for compatibility. 
Trying to add an animal to a cage that already contains an incompatible animal will raise an exception.
